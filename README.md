# HangmanApp BE-R-Task Krzysztof Fudro

The task generally seemed to be quite easy but with my poor experience, over three years without coding and none experience in C# it wasn't. 
I've spent a lot of time getting to know C# basics, searching useful functions and adapting my C++ knowledge into C#. 
At the end of this adventure I'm really satisfied with code I had written, ideas I had but I did't make because of deadline (i.a. //TODO: in the comments). 
It was pleasure faced this task. Greetings.
